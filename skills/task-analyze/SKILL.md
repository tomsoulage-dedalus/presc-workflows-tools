# Task Analyze Skill

## Required configuration

The user must have these environment variables configured:
- `JIRA_DOMAIN`: Jira domain (e.g. `jira.dedalus.com`)
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN`: Jira Server Personal Access Token (PAT)
- `JIRA_AC_FIELD`: custom field for Acceptance Criteria (default `customfield_10028`)

> Variables are defined in `~/.bashrc`. **Always run `source ~/.bashrc`** before any action to load them.

## Available commands

### `/task-analyze <ISSUE_KEY>`
Full analysis workflow:
1. Validate the ticket key
2. Read the Jira ticket fields
3. Fetch linked issues
4. Fetch remote links (Confluence pages, web links)
5. Fetch attachments
6. **Investigate the codebase** (search for relevant code)
7. **Generate fix hypotheses** (for Defects) or **implementation hints** (for Stories)
8. **Save ANALYZE.md** to `<repo_root>/.copilot/analyses/<ISSUE_KEY>-ANALYZE.md` where `<repo_root>` is the git repository root (`$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`)
9. Display the full analysis in the chat

## Type detection rule

**The type is inferred from the ticket prefix:**

| Ticket prefix | Type   |
|---------------|--------|
| `HORME-`      | Story  |
| `ORBISBUG-`   | Defect |

---

## Detailed behaviour

### Step 1 — Validate and detect type from ticket key

```
If <ISSUE_KEY> starts with "HORME-"   → type = Story
If <ISSUE_KEY> starts with "ORBISBUG-" → type = Defect
Otherwise → display "❌ Unknown ticket prefix. Expected: HORME-XXXX or ORBISBUG-XXXX"
```

### Step 2 — Read the Jira ticket

Run in the terminal:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JIRA_API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "https://${JIRA_DOMAIN}/rest/api/2/issue/<ISSUE_KEY>?fields=summary,description,priority,components,labels,issuelinks,attachment,${JIRA_AC_FIELD:-customfield_10028}"
```

Extract:
- `SUMMARY` = `fields.summary`
- `DESCRIPTION` = `fields.description` (parse ADF format to markdown)
- `PRIORITY` = `fields.priority.name`
- `COMPONENTS` = `fields.components[].name`
- `LABELS` = `fields.labels[]`
- `AC` = `fields.${JIRA_AC_FIELD}`
- `ISSUE_LINKS` = `fields.issuelinks[]`
- `ATTACHMENTS` = `fields.attachment[]`

### Step 3 — Fetch remote links (Confluence / web docs)

Run in the terminal:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JIRA_API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "https://${JIRA_DOMAIN}/rest/api/2/issue/<ISSUE_KEY>/remotelink"
```

This returns a JSON array. For each entry, extract:
- `object.title` = link title
- `object.url` = URL
- `relationship` = relation type (e.g. `Confluence Page`, `Web Link`, `mentioned in`, etc.)

Group the links by type:
- **Confluence pages**: URLs containing `/wiki/` or `/confluence/` or with `relationship` mentioning Confluence
- **Web links**: all others

### Step 4 — Fetch linked Confluence page content (optional, best-effort)

For each Confluence link found in Step 3, attempt to retrieve its content using the Confluence REST API:

```bash
# Extract the page ID from the URL: /wiki/spaces/.../pages/<PAGE_ID>/...
# Then call:
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JIRA_API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "https://${JIRA_DOMAIN}/wiki/rest/api/content/<PAGE_ID>?expand=body.storage,version,space"
```

If the call succeeds, extract:
- `title` = page title
- `space.name` = space name
- `version.number` = page version
- `body.storage.value` = page content (HTML/storage format, summarize key sections)

> If the page is not accessible or the URL format doesn't contain a page ID, skip silently and display `⚠️ Content not accessible` next to the link.

### Step 5 — Codebase investigation

Extract **search keywords** from the ticket summary and description. Use a mix of:
- Domain terms (e.g. "prescription", "duplication", "simplified")
- UI action terms (e.g. "edit", "open", "duplicate", "click")
- Technical terms mentioned (e.g. component names, service names, Angular event names)

Then **search the codebase** using grep/glob tools:

1. **Find relevant Angular components/services** by searching for keywords in `.ts` and `.html` files:
   - Search for the feature name or action in component/service file names
   - Search for method names or event handlers related to the described behaviour

2. **Read the most relevant files** (up to 5 files, prioritize components with matching methods):
   - Focus on the code path described by the bug/story scenario
   - Extract relevant snippets (functions, methods, template bindings)

3. **Build a `CODE_FINDINGS` summary** from what was found:
   - List each relevant file with its path and a brief description of its role
   - Include key code snippets (10–30 lines max per snippet) that are directly related to the issue
   - Note any suspicious patterns (e.g. shared mutable state, index-based lookups, missing `trackBy`)

> If no relevant code is found, write "No relevant code identified in the codebase."

### Step 6 — Generate fix hypotheses (Defect) or implementation hints (Story)

Based on the description and `CODE_FINDINGS`, generate a `HYPOTHESES` section:

**For a Defect:**
- List 2–4 ranked hypotheses explaining the root cause, from most to least likely
- For each hypothesis:
  - Describe the suspected mechanism
  - Point to the specific file/function/line that may be responsible
  - Suggest a concrete fix (code change or approach)

**For a Story:**
- List 2–3 implementation approaches
- For each approach:
  - Describe the strategy
  - List the files/components that would need to be created or modified
  - Highlight any risks or dependencies

### Step 7 — Save ANALYZE.md

Create the directory if needed and save the full analysis to a markdown file:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
mkdir -p "${REPO_ROOT}/.copilot/analyses"
```

Then write the file `${REPO_ROOT}/.copilot/analyses/<ISSUE_KEY>-ANALYZE.md` using the **same content** as the chat display (Step 8), in markdown format.

After saving, display:
```
💾 Analysis saved to: <repo_root>/.copilot/analyses/<ISSUE_KEY>-ANALYZE.md
```

### Step 8 — Display the full analysis

Display a structured analysis in the chat:

```

## Error handling

- Unknown prefix (neither `HORME-` nor `ORBISBUG-`) → "❌ Unknown prefix. Use HORME-XXXX or ORBISBUG-XXXX"
- Ticket not found in Jira → "❌ Ticket <KEY> not found on ${JIRA_DOMAIN}"
- No token configured → "❌ Configure JIRA_API_TOKEN in ~/.bashrc"
- Remote links API returns empty → display "None" for the docs section
- Confluence page not accessible → display `⚠️ Content not accessible` and continue
- Codebase search finds nothing → display "No relevant code identified in the codebase."
- File write fails → display `⚠️ Could not save ANALYZE.md: <error>` and continue
